# burger
## We're taking on McDonald's baby!!
### Just kidding of course. This is a simple app that's pretty useless and doesn't event make or order you any food. You can add burgers to your list and then indicate whether or not you've eaten it. All data is stored on a MySQL database. 

## Instructions
* Using the app is pretty self explanetory. If you can't figure it out, maybe just go back to sleep....

## Notes
* the app uses node, express, handlebars and an MVC framework
* data is stored in MySQL and a self-made proprietary ORM is used to interface with the database
* could add a lot of other features to this... ultimately i don't see a market for this product though....
